# Decisions

Back in 2018 the team decided to start documenting all kinds of decisions with ADR documents (Architecture decision record documents).

You can read a bit about [ADRs here](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).

Since we started using ADRs they are spread through multiple repositories and this page serves to try and tie them back together.
