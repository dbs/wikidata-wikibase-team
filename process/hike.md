# Hike

**Hikers (Metaphors)**

- A group of people going off camp for a limited amount of time for a journey.
- They have a **goal** to achieve and a **clear map**.
- They will return to the camp at the end of the hike with their findings and knowledge
- They can invite people from other camps to join their hike
- A group of hikers will choose one person to navigate or decide that the whole group would share that responsibility

**Campers will…**

- form around a product on the roadmap
- not last more than 1Q to avoid long running teams
- work in Scrum and follow the turtles process
- form in a **kickoff meeting (Bonfire meeting)** driven by a **Product Manager** where the **developers can decide whether they want to join a hike** and who else there is needed
- Hikers can invite other non-engineers to join a hike (UX for example) for limited amount of time or for the full hike.
- If we need to hike but a hike doesn’t form - then the Engineering Manager can choose the hikers for a journey
- Possible hikers should state their planned unavailability before the hike team is formed, allowing for more accurate grasping of actual resources available

- Hikes are not limited by amount of people as long as the camp is protected.
- Hikers are obligated to help campers with maintenance / bugs tasks while being on hike (**20% of their time**) as consultation only (code review / knowledge sharing, but **not to solve the problems**)
- If a hike is longer than a quarter, the hikers will break apart and meet for a new bonfire meeting and reform
    - Some of the original hikers will stay
    - New hikers will join 
    - Goals: 
        - To improve knowledge sharing 
        - Be able to react to changes (we might need more / less people)
        - Avoid long running hikes
        - Adding new perspective to the hike.
- Product Manager is a part of any hike and acts as a member of the hike’s rituals 
- Several hikes can happen at the same time
- A hiker is a part of one hike only at a time
