# Journeys

**Journey** An act of travelling, in our case to achieve something. Journeys have goals.

- **Hike** - journey with a clear map
- **Trailblaze** - journey without a map

EMs, in close collaboration with PMs as roadmap owners, will have a final say when journeys will start / whether it’s something that should start.

### All journeys:

- start with a bonfire
- are made up of a group of people going off camp for a **limited amount of time**.
- will have a **goal** to achieve.
- will **return to the camp** at the end of the hike with their findings and knowledge.
- will choose one person to be the **navigator**, or decide that the whole group would share that responsibility

## Bonfire

<ProcessTable
  :what="[
    'A meeting, run by a product representative, that takes place in camp, before a journey starts.',
  ]"
  :why="[
    'Present the joruney to the team',
    'Decide who goes on the journey',
  ]"
  who="All involved parties of the journey should attend: Engineers, Product Manager, UX/Com/Architect (if needed)"
/>

Members of the Wikidata camp are **strongly encouraged** to say **no** if they feel that a **journey is not well prepared**, a **journey** will only work if the **goals are clear**.

## Process Overview

At the beginning of a **hike’s / trailblaze’s** lifecycle there will be a **journey start meeting** where all the boards will be created by the Engineering Manager and those who are going on the **journey** will set their **scrum meetings times**.

The **navigator** will act as the **process master**.

| Rituals & Details      |  |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Daily      | ✔️ Every workday       |
| Story Time   | ✔️ Once a week, 30 minutes     |
| Task Breakdown | ✔️ Once a week, 45 minutes |
| Retrospective | ✔️ Every 2 weeks, 60 minutes. |
| Working mode | Iterations every 14 to 21 days (Team's decision) |
| Commitment | Finish what was picked up on the Sprint board |

## Hikes

Journyes that have **clear map** to achieve their goal,

- form around a product on the roadmap
- can invite people from other camps to join their hike.
- are not limited by amount of people as long as the camp is protected.
- should not last more than 1Q to avoid long running teams

**Hikers will…**

- form in a **kickoff meeting (Bonfire meeting)** driven by a **Product Manager** where the **developers can decide whether they want to join a hike** and who else there is needed
- Hikers can invite other non-engineers to join a hike (UX for example) for limited amount of time or for the full hike.
- If we need to hike but a hike doesn’t form - then the Engineering Manager can choose the hikers for a journey
- Possible hikers should state their planned unavailability before the hike team is formed, allowing for more accurate grasping of actual resources available
- Hikers are obligated to help campers with maintenance / bugs tasks while being on hike (**20% of their time**) as consultation only (code review / knowledge sharing, but **not to solve the problems**)
- Product Manager is a part of any hike and acts as a member of the hike’s rituals 
- A hiker is a part of one hike only at a time

## Trailblazes

Journeys that **don’t have a clear map** and they **need to find a way** to acheive their goal.

**Anyone** can form a kickoff meeting and try to convince the group why their idea is compelling and why people should join a **trailblaze** for that idea/goal, EM will have a final say when those will start / whether it’s something that should start.

## Long running journeys

If a **hike / trailblazing** takes **longer than a quarter**, and there are **enough engineers covering the campsite** in order to exchange duties with the current team:
- The members of the journey shall organise a Marshmallows or S’mores meeting where they will share with the rest of the team:
  - The relevant technical decisions they have made along the way and why. Note: the definition of “relevant” will be left for the team to decide. The idea is to share as much as possible of the learnings that other teams might face at some point.
  - The current status of the project
  - Challenges they have encountered, how they tackled them. Note: we are not only looking at the solution here but also the process that precedes the decision.
  - Known upcoming challenges
- The members of the journey shall disband 
- A bonfire meeting will be organised by the Product Manager and a new crew will be formed. Former members of the hike are allowed to participate. 
  - The size of this new team might differ from the former one. This will be agreed upon among PM, EMs and engineers depending on what is left to implement and what has been learned along the hike.
  - If there are no former members among the new crew, those will need to be aware that they might be consulted on several occasions and will need to prioritise this.
  - The goal of this shuffling is to give engineers the chance to change scenery, improve knowledge sharing, add new perspective / ideas to the current journey.
