## **Change Dispatch to Jobs**

* **Status:**    Live    
* **Production Release:**  2021 Q4


### **Project Goal:**

Several maintenance scripts were being run as cron jobs, which are not native to puppet6. With puppet6 soon to be in production at the WMF, these scripts were updated to use systemtimers.
