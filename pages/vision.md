# Vision

An old team owned and developed technical vision diagram was created with the GoJS diagram library in 2020.

This old vision is maintained in [this repository](https://github.com/wmde/wikidata-wikibase-vision).

A new version of this vision will be created in early - mid 2021 and will exist and be documented on this site.
